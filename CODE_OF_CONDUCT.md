# Code of Conduct

This project and its community are governed by the [W3C Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/). We expect all participants to have read it and to follow it.

In addition to the W3C Code of Conduct, we have the following project-specific expectations to ensure a healthy and constructive environment.

## Our Expectations

- **Focus on DX and UX:** The goal of this project is to gather and elevate signals from web developers. Frame discussions and contributions around evidence of developer needs and their potential impact on developer and user experiences.
- **Provide Structured Feedback:** When submitting developer feedback on web features, please follow the suggested template provided in each issue. Clearly describe your specific use case and any workarounds you are currently using.
- **Guide, Don't Debate:** This is not a forum for technical debate. When replying to another developer's use case, do so in a way that constructively clarifies and strengthens the signal. If a different feature may be a better fit for their stated problem, suggest it helpfully and without criticism.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be [reported to repository admins](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam#reporting-a-comment). All reports will be handled with discretion and in accordance with the W3C's enforcement procedures.
